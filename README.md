# DSA-Questions on Leetcode 

Hello, Welcome to this repo. This is like a blog where I share my leetcode solutions to the problems I solve. 

I focus on 
- Solving the problem
- Solving them fast
- solving them in the least memory possible

I'm writing these solutions cause I feel the people and even I will benefit from them at times when I need to see the solutions. 

I'm solving the problems in Python for now but I'll shift to C++ in some time.
